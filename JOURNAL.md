## 10/24/2025 2 PM - figuring out which microcontroller and relay to use  

### project outlook....
controlling about 15-16 lights which lightup my house from front and create multiple creative and visually appealing patterns via the same and not having to turn them on and off at specific timing.

### **microcontroller selection**
based on my requirement of controlling about 15-16 lights i figured out that using esp32 would be best as i need it to be working without a timer module like those DS3212 modules... and adding the website functionality would be easier as it has 2 cores in esp32 and has more GPIO pins as compared to esp8266.. so finalized with this one.
### **relay selection**
i have the generic 12v and 5v coil relay and they can handle upto 10A of current at 12v and nearly 2A at 220v so it should work for me.. and i went with 5v relay as i would help me easily power with a single 5v adapter.![WhatsApp Image 2025-10-24 at 14.05.38_13e04f07.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTA0OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3b223c5a17f030746409057228c54c382877d194/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-10-24%20at%2014.05.38_13e04f07.jpg)
  

## 10/24/2025 5 PM - wiring and testing relay  

### wiring the 5v relay 
used a bare relay at first learned how to hook up a relay wired it with two lights to check the output and if its working in its NO & NC 
had this working

switching to a more cleaner version made it with a PCB
attached a wire terminal with screws. had this working but since it took me too long to solder and wire this single module. i thought of an alternate

### **using module instead**
i found myself 2 8 channel relay module and i decided to go with it..
it fullfills the requirement as it now gives me option to control 16 points..

furthermore planned on how will i wire the lights 
so there are 13 lights
7 pink 6 white
along with 1 pink rope light and 1 white rope light
so they will be connected like this
