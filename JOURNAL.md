## 10/24/2025 2 PM - figuring out which microcontroller and relay to use  

### project outlook....
controlling about 15-16 lights which lightup my house from front and create multiple creative and visually appealing patterns via the same and not having to turn them on and off at specific timing.

### **microcontroller selection**
based on my requirement of controlling about 15-16 lights i figured out that using esp32 would be best as i need it to be working without a timer module like those DS3212 modules... and adding the website functionality would be easier as it has 2 cores in esp32 and has more GPIO pins as compared to esp8266.. so finalized with this one.
### **relay selection**
i have the generic 12v and 5v coil relay and they can handle upto 10A of current at 12v and nearly 2A at 220v so it should work for me.. and i went with 5v relay as i would help me easily power with a single 5v adapter.![WhatsApp Image 2025-10-24 at 14.05.38_13e04f07.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTA0OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3b223c5a17f030746409057228c54c382877d194/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-10-24%20at%2014.05.38_13e04f07.jpg)
  

## 10/24/2025 5 PM - wiring and testing relay  

### wiring the 5v relay 
used a bare relay at first learned how to hook up a relay wired it with two lights to check the output and if its working in its NO & NC 
had this working

switching to a more cleaner version made it with a PCB
attached a wire terminal with screws. had this working but since it took me too long to solder and wire this single module. i thought of an alternate

### **using module instead**
i found myself 2 8 channel relay module and i decided to go with it..
it fullfills the requirement as it now gives me option to control 16 points..

furthermore planned on how will i wire the lights 
so there are 13 lights
7 pink 6 white
along with 1 pink rope light and 1 white rope light
so they will be connected like this 
  

## 10/25/2025 1 PM - completed the prototype   

finally hooked up two 8 channel relay with the esp and a single voltage regulator for the same.

the final wiring diagram looks like ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTM3NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8a74da9183fbe77c20bb067e6632e53bb9525e3d/image.png)
thats the basic wiring hooked up with jumper cables from the esp to relay module...
further, 
most of my time went in coding this 
started out with basic lighting patterns to test out the concept..

afterwards i have used AI to come up with different patterns and their code for the same 
as this could get repatative in coding...

after ensuring all of this is working seemlessly it took me multiple iterations to get the web portal working in sync without blocking the webserver response system.. 
 after all this it was finally completed 

we have a functional WEB interface in the local network and it allows me to switch pattern alter timing of each mode and enabling and disabling it.

## 10/25/2025 10 PM - finishing up  

Finished the project hardwired the 220V leds and tested them out. worked flawlessly

attached the esp onto breadboard and mounted it onto the wood piece and screwed the relay boards into place... controlled the phase wire of the 220v lights and lit up my house tastefully!!
